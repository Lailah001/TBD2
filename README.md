## *[In a few sentences, describe the main idea.]*
TBD is a story-based game where the user can select from a given list of characters and will need to get their character from point A to B based on their character’s personality. The user is given information about their character’s personality and typical decision-making, as well as how the story begins and ends, but are not given the middle of the story. The user will need to correctly identify which choices their character would make to get from beginning to end. Users win the game by successfully completing the story from their character’s point of view.

## *[In a few sentences, summarize any technical dependencies.]*
We will be using React (JavaScript, JSX (includes HTML)), and CSS for the frontend. We will use NodeJS for our backend environment. Firebase will be used for data storage and management, and Google for users to use their existing login information. Our code will be created in Visual Studio 2019, and source code will be managed through GitHub.
